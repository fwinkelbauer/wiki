# Habits

## The Habit Loop

- Cue
- Response
- Reward

To change your habit you need to know what the cue is, and watch out for it.
When it happens, you need to replace the habit with a difference response that
gives the reward. Part of figuring out your cue is looking at

- People around you
- Emotional State
- Location
- Time
- Immediately Preceding Action

## Goals

### Set specific goals

We tend to create "Be" goals (e.g. "I want to be fit") which we should turn into
actionable goals.

### Set few goals

We have a limited amount of willpower per day. This means that you should focus
on only a few goals.

### Set attainable goals

Use small steps to boost your confidence. **Reflect regularly**!

### Design your environment

- Remove impulses and distractions
- Create an environment which helps you to achieve your goal
- The intended way should be more conveniant than any other possibility

### Make it stick

- Block time in your day
- Create cues (e.g. visual, or clock alarm)

# Triggers (Marshall Goldsmith)

## Four Stages of a Feedback Loops

- Evidence (seeing how fast you are driving)
- Relevance (you know that you are too fast)
- Consqequence (you might get a ticket)
- Action (so you reduce your speed)

## Two Truths

1. Meaningful behavioural change is very hard to do
2. No one can make us change unless we truly want to change

## Snippets

- Our environment influences our behaviour more than we might think.
  **Example:** You behave different when you are standing in traffic.
- We are inaccurate in assessing ourselves
- We are great planners, but reluctant doers
- A trigger is only a problem if our reaction creates a problem
- There are areas in our lifes in which we think that we can "just wing it"
- We need help when we are least likely to get it. We behave against our own
  interest and might not even realise it.
- "We are professionals at what we do, amateurs at what what we want to become."

## The Wheel of Change

- **Creating:** A positive element that we want to create
- **Elimination:** A positive element that we want to keep
- **Accepting:** A negative element that we need to accept
- **Preserving:** A negative element that we want to eliminate

## Types of Triggers

- **Encouraging:** We want it
- **Productive:** We need it
- **Discouraging:** We don't want it
- **Counter-Productive:** We don't need it

These four categories form a rectangle which can describe several types of
behaviour. **Example:** Temptation ("We want it, but don't need it").

**Exercise:** Pick a behaviour goal you are pursuing. Now list all the people
and situations that influence the quality of your performance. Identify and
label the triggers related to your goal.

## Active Questions

- Passive questions ("Do you have clear goals?") allow us to take a free pass,
  meaning that we can blame someone else for a problem ("Oh my manager just
  doesn't know what he wants!").
- Active questions ("Did I do my best today to set clear goals for myself") put
  us into the driver seat. This type of question makes us accountable and asks
  us to defend our actions. They motivate us "to try".
- Rate yourself on your active questions between 1 (low) and 10 (highest).
  Report your score regularly.
- If your scores keep sinking, decide: Do I want to drop this question, or
  should I try harder?
- These active questions can be used with an hourly reminder for short burt
  applications (e.g. working with an "annyoing" colleague)
