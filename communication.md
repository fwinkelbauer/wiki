# Communication

Favor interrogative-led questions over leading questions. A leading question
attempts to get the listener to agree or disagree with a premise you feed to
them. An interrogative-led question often begins with the words: who; where;
what; when; why.

Imagine the responses to these two questions:

- "Did you like the movie?" (Leading)
- "What did you think about the movie?" (Interrogative-led)

How do each of these questions make you feel? How comfortable would you be
saying something you think would displease the asker in each case. What kind of
responses are possible/likely in each case?
