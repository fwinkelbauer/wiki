# Falling Asleep

Copied from this [blog post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17905574):

> 1. Relax the muscles in your face, including tongue, jaw and the muscles around
>    the eyes
> 2. Drop your shoulders as far down as they’ll go, followed by your upper and
>    lower arm, one side at a time
> 3. Breathe out, relaxing your chest followed by your legs, starting from the
>    thighs and working down
> 4. You should then spend 10 seconds trying to clear your mind before thinking
>    about one of the three following images:
>     - You’re lying in a canoe on a calm lake with nothing but a clear blue sky
>       above you
>     - You’re lying in a black velvet hammock in a pitch-black room
>     - You say “don’t think, don’t think, don’t think” to yourself over and over
>       for about 10 seconds.
