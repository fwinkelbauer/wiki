# Creativitiy

[John Cleese on Creativity in Management][cleese]:

**Open Mode** (the creative mode)

- "The ability to play"
- Play for your own enjoyment, curiosity because of its own sake
- We are relaxed, inclined to humor and more playful

**Close Mode**

- The "default mode" when we are at work
- We are impatient, purposful

We need the "open mode" to find a way and we need the "closed mode" to follow
through with our plans. We are the most efficient when we switch between these
two modes. The problem: We tend to get stuck in the "closed mode".

There are conditions that make it more likely to get into the "open mode":

- **Space**
  - You need an undisturbed environment
- **Time**
  - Have a specific time in which you are operating in your undisturbed
    environment
  - It takes some time before your mind starts to quiet down
  - Take about an hour and a half, not longer
  - You have to stick to a problem in order to find an original solution
- **Confidence**
  - "Whatever happens is ok". While you are creative, nothing is wrong
- **Humor**
  - Is an essential part to be creative

Other people can help us to be more creative, but only if they make us feel
good. There is no place for "No", "I don't like that" or "You are wrong".
