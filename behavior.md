# Behavior

## Communication

Favor interrogative-led questions over leading questions. A leading question
attempts to get the listener to agree or disagree with a premise you feed to
them. An interrogative-led question often begins with the words: who; where;
what; when; why.

Imagine the responses to these two questions:

- "Did you like the movie?" (Leading)
- "What did you think about the movie?" (Interrogative-led)

How do each of these questions make you feel? How comfortable would you be
saying something you think would displease the asker in each case. What kind of
responses are possible/likely in each case?

## When (Daniel H. Pink)

### Chapter 1

- Timing is not an art, it's a science.
- Do **not** go to the hospital in the afternoon. Seriously. Don't.

Our cognitive abilities change over the course of a day. Even if we think that
"this does not apply to us", these forces have a greater impact than we believe.
We can split a day into three mood phases:

- Peak
- Through
- Recovery

The order in which we move through these phases depends on our chronotype. We
distinguish between larks, third birds and owls.

- Larks and third birds: peak, trough, recovery
- Owls: recovery, trough, peak

| State    | Task           |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Peak     | Analytic       |
| Trough   | Administrative |
| Recovery | Insight        |

- **Analytic:** You want to get rid of distractions. Do tasks that require focus
  and vigilance
- **Administrative:** Your mood drops. Do the "boring stuff"
- **Insight:** Your mood is recovering. You are more inclined to say yes. Do
  tasks that require you to be creative

To do better in the morning:

- Drink a glass of water after waking up
- Avoid coffee right after waking up
- Soak up the morning sun

### Chapter 2

Effective breaks:

- Work for 52 minutes and then break for 17 minutes
- Moving beats stationary
- Take breaks in company, but do not talk about work related issues
- Go outside
- Do not use your phone to check mails or social media
- Schedule breaks just like you would schedule a meeting

Lunch is the most important meal of the day. Avoid the "sad desk lunch".

Effective naps:

- Between 10 and 20 minutes
- Drink a cup of coffee right before taking a nap
- The Mayo clinic says that the best time for a nap is between 14:00 and 15:00
- Turn it into a habit. If you cannot do that, take a nap when you did not get
  enough sleep, our your day feels more stressful than usual

## [John Cleese on Creativity in Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g)

**Open Mode** (the creative mode)

- "The ability to play"
- Play for your own enjoyment, curiosity because of its own sake
- We are relaxed, inclined to humor and more playful

**Close Mode**

- The "default mode" when we are at work
- We are impatient, purposeful

We need the "open mode" to find a way and we need the "closed mode" to follow
through with our plans. We are the most efficient when we switch between these
two modes. The problem: We tend to get stuck in the "closed mode".

There are conditions that make it more likely to get into the "open mode":

- **Space**
  - You need an undisturbed environment
- **Time**
  - Have a specific time in which you are operating in your undisturbed
    environment
  - It takes some time before your mind starts to quiet down
  - Take about an hour and a half, not longer
  - You have to stick to a problem in order to find an original solution
- **Confidence**
  - "Whatever happens is ok". While you are creative, nothing is wrong
- **Humor**
  - Is an essential part to be creative

Other people can help us to be more creative, but only if they make us feel
good. There is no place for "No", "I don't like that" or "You are wrong".

## How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big (Scott Adams)

### Happiness Formula

- Eat right
- Exercise
- Get enough sleep
- Imagine an incredible future
- Work toward a flexible schedule
- Do things you can steadily improve at
- Help others (if you've already helped yourself)
- Reduce daily decisions to routine

### Business Writing

- No passive
- Main message in first sentence
- Who, what, when, where, why, how
- Read it twice (corrections)
- Read it twice (meaning, wait before you read it again)
- Less is more

## Healthy Eating

Based on this [article][grub]:

- **Gist:** Whole foods, minimally processed, mostly plants, and plain water
- Emphasize on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds,
  and plain water for thirst. That can be with or without seafood; with or
  without dairy; with or without eggs; with or without some meat; high or low in
  total fat
- All the Blue Zone diets - the diets around the world associated with longevity
  and vitality - contain beans. Beans are really, really, really good for us
- We should eat more fiber (regular people: 15g, recommended: 30-100g)
- Extra virgin olive oil, cold-pressed canola oil > coconut oil
  - Do not use cold-pressed oil in combination with a lot of heat
- Sugar and sweetness trigger appetite, so we simply tend to eat more when sugar
  is added to an ingredient list. The food industry uses this all the time

The five healthy habits were defined as:

- Not smoking
- Having a body mass index between 18.5 and 25
- Taking at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day
- Having no more than one 150ml glass of wine a day for women, or two for men
- Having a diet rich in items such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains and
  low in red meat, saturated fats and sugar

## [You Are Not So Smart Podcast](https://youarenotsosmart.com/)

### The Memory Illusion (Episode #179)

- A perfect memory in a young age might mean that there is something wrong
- There is no such thing as a "perfect" memory. People might outperform others
  in certain areas, but they can be "normal" in other areas
- Introverts tend to not remember details. Instead they remember how they felt
  or what their opinion was in that situation
- We change old memories all the time. We generalize and filter. That's what our
  brains do. It's a healthy process
- Therapy focuses on interpreting past events in a different light

### The Dunning-Kruger Effect (Episode #192)

- We can be so incompetent that we don't even realize how incompetent we are
- You want a confident general leading a battle, but you want an unconfident
  general when planning the battle
- Naysayers can be valuable to find situations in which you are too confident
- Reflect on your previous work/thoughts 5-10 years ago. Do you like what you
  did? Answering "no" can be an indicator that you have learned something
- Accept that you can be wrong
