# [Perfect Timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbicgT4KrWc)

- Timing is not an art, it's a science.
- Do **not** go to the hospital in the afternoon. Seriously. Don't.

There are larks, third birds and owls.

- Larks and third birds: peak, trough, recovery
- Owls: recovery, trough, peak

| State    | Task           |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Peak     | Analytic       |
| Trough   | Administrative |
| Recovery | Insight        |

- **Analytic:** You want to get rid of distractions. Do tasks that require focus
  and vigilance
- **Administrative:** Your mood drops. Do the "boring stuff"
- **Insight:** Your mood is recovering. You are more inclined to say yes. Do
  tasks that require you to be creative
