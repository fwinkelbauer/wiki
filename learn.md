Taken from [this blog post](https://betterexplained.com/articles/adept-method/).

Make explanations ADEPT. Use:

- An Analogy
- A Diagram
- An Example
- A Plain-English description
- And A technical description

**Example:** Version Control Systems

Analogy/Diagram: Think about a writing project back in school where people would
send e-mails with their document with notes on what they changed.

Example: Come up with a short text and show how several project members make
changes to a single document in a distributed manner.

Plain-English description: Outline that a VCS deals with the task of creating a
single document out of a number of documents in a way that makes sense.

Technical description: Talk about change sets, branches and operations on change
sets (such as merges).
