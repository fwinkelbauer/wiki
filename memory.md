# You Are Not So Smart #197

Episode 179 of [You Are Not So Smart](https://youarenotsosmart.com/) with Dr.
Julia Shaw:

- A perfect memory in a young age might mean that there is something wrong
- There is no such thing as a "perfect" memory. People might outperform others
  in certain areas, but they can be "normal" in other areas
- Introverts tend to not remember details. Instead they remember how they felt
  or what their opinion was in that situation
- We change old memories all the time. We generalize and filter. That's what our
  brains do. It's a healthy process
- Therapy focuses on interpreting past events in a different light
