## Preventing the Collapse of Civilization (Jonathan Blow)

[Found on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk):

- Technology on its own will degrade. It needs constant effort to improve and
  not lose technology.
- Without generational transfer, civilizations die.
- How productive are programming languages at a higher abstraction level (think
  C#, Haskell or JavaScript) REALLY? The first version of Unix was written in
  three weeks.
- We keep adding complexity, which means that each individual knows less and
  less about a system.
- We are reducing development time by using existing tools and frameworks, but
  we are also giving up capability. This is fine in isolation, but it might
  become a problem if everyone does it.
- Only a handful of people **really** know how a CPU works
- Our tools change our thought process.
