# Antifragility (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)

An antifragile system benefits from disorder

- Have options (instead of obligations)
- Create a situation with low downside and high upside
- Create systems with slack

## Nonlinear events

- Convex: a smiling graph. More potential upside than downside (positive Black
  Swan)
- Concave: a frowning graph. More potential downside than upside (negative Black
  Swan)
- You are robust if doubling exposure doubles harm
- You are fragile if doubling exposure more than doubles harm
- A single 100 pound stone hurts more than 100 one pound stones

## Example

Traffic is a function, which depends on the amount of cars. This function is
nonlinear (concave), as the following two situations create different outputs:

- One hour of 8.000 cars, followed by one hour of 12.000 cars
- Two hours of 10.000 cars

**Important:** Don't confuse x with f(x).

In general:

- A function is concave if the average function value is lower than the
  function of the average value
- A function is convex if the average function value is higher than the function
  of the average value
