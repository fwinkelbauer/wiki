# Antifragility

An antifragile system benefits from disorder

- Have options (instead of obligations)
- Create a situation with low downside and high upside
- Create systems with slack

Nonlinear events:

- Convex: a smiling graph. More potential upside than downside (positive Black
  Swan)
- Concave: a frowning graph. More potential downside than upside (negative Black
  Swan)
- You are robust if doubling exposure doubles harm
- You are fragile if doubling exposure more than doubles harm
- A single 100 pound stone hurts more than 100 one pound stones
