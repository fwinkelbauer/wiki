## The Memory Illusion (Episode #179)

- A perfect memory in a young age might mean that there is something wrong
- There is no such thing as a "perfect" memory. People might outperform others
  in certain areas, but they can be "normal" in other areas
- Introverts tend to not remember details. Instead they remember how they felt
  or what their opinion was in that situation
- We change old memories all the time. We generalize and filter. That's what our
  brains do. It's a healthy process
- Therapy focuses on interpreting past events in a different light

## The Dunning-Kruger Effect (Episode #192)

- We can be so incompetent that we don't even realize how incompetent we are
- You want a confident general leading a battle, but you want an unconfident
  general when planning the battle
- Naysayers can be valuable to find situations in which you are too confident
- Reflect on your previous work/thoughts 5-10 years ago. Do you like what you
  did? Answering "no" can be an indicator that you have learned something
- Accept that you can be wrong
