# When (Daniel H. Pink)

## Chapter 1

- Timing is not an art, it's a science.
- Do **not** go to the hospital in the afternoon. Seriously. Don't.

Our cognitive abilities change over the course of a day. Even if we think that
"this does not apply to us", these forces have a greater impact than we believe.
We can split a day into three mood phases:

- Peak
- Through
- Recovery

The order in which we move through these phases depends on our chronotype. We
distinguish between larks, third birds and owls.

- Larks and third birds: peak, trough, recovery
- Owls: recovery, trough, peak

| State    | Task           |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Peak     | Analytic       |
| Trough   | Administrative |
| Recovery | Insight        |

- **Analytic:** You want to get rid of distractions. Do tasks that require focus
  and vigilance
- **Administrative:** Your mood drops. Do the "boring stuff"
- **Insight:** Your mood is recovering. You are more inclined to say yes. Do
  tasks that require you to be creative

To do better in the morning:

- Drink a glass of water after waking up
- Avoid coffee right after waking up
- Soak up the morning sun

Effective breaks:

- Work for 52 minutes and then break for 17 minutes
- Moving beats stationary
- Take breaks in company, but do not talk about work related issues
- Go outside
- Do not use your phone to check mails or social media
- Schedule breaks just like you would schedule a meeting

Lunch is the most important meal of the day. Avoid the "sad desk lunch".

Effective naps:

- Between 10 and 20 minutes
- Drink a cup of coffee right before taking a nap
- The Mayo clinic says that the best time for a nap is between 14:00 and 15:00
- Turn it into a habit. If you cannot do that, take a nap when you did not get
  enough sleep, our your day feels more stressful than usual
