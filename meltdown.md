# Meltdown (Chris Clearfield, Andr√°s Tilcsik)

**Why our systems fail and what we can do about it**

Complexity and coupling increase the chance of big errors. In these systems,
small problems and minor issues can accumulate into an unforeseen meltdown.

In the past, nuclear power plants were one of only a few systems which were both
complex and highly coupled. Over the last years more and more systems entered
this domain.

How to deal with these systems:

- Introduce slack
- Reduce moving parts
- Replace indirect feedback with direct feedback
  - Example of indirect feedback: An indicator light that shows that a valve was
    instructed to close
  - Example of direct feedback: An indicator light which shows the actual state
    (open/closed) of a valve

Techniques:

- Aviation and medical institutions use "near miss reports" to deal with small
  issues before they can spiral out of control
- Use hindsight bias by performing a premortem. Imagine that the project is
  completed and that it was a complete failure. What were the reasons why it
  failed?
- Subjective Probability Interval Estimates (SPIES): Estimate the probability of
  several outcomes

Lessons:

- Charm school (Everyone should be able to express concern)
  - Get attention
  - Express your concern
  - State the perceived problem
  - Propose a solution
  - Ask for agreement
- Soften power cues
  - This makes you more approachable, which can encourage people to speak their
    mind
- Leaders speak last
  - Encourage discussion about different solutions
  - Not encouraging a discussion can be compared to discouraging a discussion

Diverse groups are "better" because group members are more skeptical which in
turn makes it more likely to catch small errors.
