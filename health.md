# Healthy Eating

Based on this [article][grub]:

- **Gist:** Whole foods, minimally processed, mostly plants, and plain water
- Emphasize on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds,
  and plain water for thirst. That can be with or without seafood; with or
  without dairy; with or without eggs; with or without some meat; high or low in
  total fat
- All the Blue Zone diets - the diets around the world associated with longevity
  and vitality - contain beans. Beans are really, really, really good for us
- We should eat more fiber (regular people: 15g, recommended: 30-100g)
- Extra virgin olive oil, cold-pressed canola oil > coconut oil
  - Do not use cold-pressed oil in combination with a lot of heat
- Sugar and sweetness trigger appetite, so we simply tend to eat more when sugar
  is added to an ingredient list. The food industry uses this all the time

The five healthy habits were defined as:

- Not smoking
- Having a body mass index between 18.5 and 25
- Taking at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day
- Having no more than one 150ml glass of wine a day for women, or two for men
- Having a diet rich in items such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains and
  low in red meat, saturated fats and sugar
