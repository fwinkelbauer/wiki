## So Good They Can't Ignore you (Cal Newport)

"Being busy is a form of laziness - lazy thinking and indiscriminate action" -
(Timothy Ferriss)

- The craftmen's mindset: focus on the value that you are offering to the world
  - Which skills can you offer that are rare and valuable?
- Deliberate practice > regular exposure
  - Stretch past where you are comfortable and get honest feedback
  - Regular routine
- Working right > finding the right work
- Two types of markets:
  - Winner Take All: Several people compete for the same set of skills (e.g.
    movie script writing)
  - Auction: Rare skill combinations make you stand out
- Control traps:
  - Trying to gain control without career capital creates resistance (you are
    not ready)
  - If you are valuable enough, your employer will try to keep you in your place
- Little bets: use small steps with fast feedback loops to gain insight into
  larger projects
- Mission: "What is my goal in my (working) life?"

### Avoid Flow. Do What Does Not Come Easy

The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into
a music hall at a local university, you'll hear people "playing" by
running through their pieces. This is a huge mistake. Strong pianists drill the
most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their
pieces in entirety.

### To Master a Skill, Master Something Harder

Strong pianists find clever ways to "complicate" the difficult parts of
their music. If we have problem playing something with clarity, we complicate by
playing the passage with alternating accent patterns. If we have problems with
speed, we confound the rhythms.

### Systematically Eliminate Weakness

Strong pianists know our weaknesses and use them to create strength. I have
sharp ears, but I am not as in touch with the physical component of piano
playing. So, I practice on a mute keyboard

### Create Beauty, Don't Avoid Ugliness

Weak pianists make music a reactive task, not a creative task. They start, and
react to their performance, fixing problems as they go along. Strong pianists,
on the other hand, have an image of what a perfect performance should be like
that includes all of the relevant senses. Before we sit down, we know what the
piece needs to feel, sound, and even look like in excruciating detail. In
performance, weak pianists try to reactively move away from mistakes, while
strong pianists move towards a perfect mental image

### Deliberate Practice

- Immediate feedback
- Training to your limits
- Technique over outcomes

Apply this through:

- Establishing a **deliberate** practice time
- Keep a skill journal to identify weak areas
- Use practice to break your (bad) habits using new methods and techniques
