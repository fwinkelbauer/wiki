## So Good They Can't Ignore you (Cal Newport)

"Being busy is a form of laziness - lazy thinking and indiscriminate action" -
(Timothy Ferriss)

- The craftmen's mindset: focus on the value that you are offering to the world
  - Which skills can you offer that are rare and valuable?
- Deliberate practice > regular exposure
  - Stretch past where you are comfortable and get honest feedback
  - Regular routine
- Working right > finding the right work
- Two types of markets:
  - Winner Take All: Several people compete for the same set of skills (e.g.
    movie script writing)
  - Auction: Rare skill combinations make you stand out
- Control traps:
  - Trying to gain control without career capital creates resistance (you are
    not ready)
  - If you are valuable enough, your employer will try to keep you in your place
- Little bets: use small steps with fast feedback loops to gain insight into
  larger projects
- Mission: "What is my goal in my (working) life?"

### Avoid Flow. Do What Does Not Come Easy

The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into
a music hall at a local university, you'll hear people "playing" by
running through their pieces. This is a huge mistake. Strong pianists drill the
most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their
pieces in entirety.

### To Master a Skill, Master Something Harder

Strong pianists find clever ways to "complicate" the difficult parts of
their music. If we have problem playing something with clarity, we complicate by
playing the passage with alternating accent patterns. If we have problems with
speed, we confound the rhythms.

### Systematically Eliminate Weakness

Strong pianists know our weaknesses and use them to create strength. I have
sharp ears, but I am not as in touch with the physical component of piano
playing. So, I practice on a mute keyboard

### Create Beauty, Don't Avoid Ugliness

Weak pianists make music a reactive task, not a creative task. They start, and
react to their performance, fixing problems as they go along. Strong pianists,
on the other hand, have an image of what a perfect performance should be like
that includes all of the relevant senses. Before we sit down, we know what the
piece needs to feel, sound, and even look like in excruciating detail. In
performance, weak pianists try to reactively move away from mistakes, while
strong pianists move towards a perfect mental image

### Deliberate Practice

- Immediate feedback
- Training to your limits
- Technique over outcomes

Apply this through:

- Establishing a **deliberate** practice time
- Keep a skill journal to identify weak areas
- Use practice to break your (bad) habits using new methods and techniques

## The Tao of Coaching (Max Landsberg)

|               | **Low Skill** | **High Skill** |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **High Will** | Guide         | Delegate       |
| **Low Will**  | Direct        | Excite         |


## The Habit Loop

- Cue
- Response
- Reward

To change your habit you need to know what the cue is, and watch out for it.
When it happens, you need to replace the habit with a difference response that
gives the reward. Part of figuring out your cue is looking at

- People around you
- Emotional State
- Location
- Time
- Immediately Preceding Action

## Goals

### Set specific goals

We tend to create "Be" goals (e.g. "I want to be fit") which we should turn into
actionable goals.

### Set few goals

We have a limited amount of willpower per day. This means that you should focus
on only a few goals.

### Set attainable goals

Use small steps to boost your confidence. **Reflect regularly**!

### Design your environment

- Remove impulses and distractions
- Create an environment which helps you to achieve your goal
- The intended way should be more convenient than any other possibility

### Make it stick

- Block time in your day
- Create cues (e.g. visual, or clock alarm)

## Triggers (Marshall Goldsmith)

### Four Stages of a Feedback Loops

- Evidence (seeing how fast you are driving)
- Relevance (you know that you are too fast)
- Consequences (you might get a ticket)
- Action (so you reduce your speed)

### Two Truths

1. Meaningful behavioral change is very hard to do
2. No one can make us change unless we truly want to change

### Snippets

- Our environment influences our behavior more than we might think.
  **Example:** You behave different when you are standing in traffic.
- We are inaccurate in assessing ourselves
- We are great planners, but reluctant doers
- A trigger is only a problem if our reaction creates a problem
- There are areas in our life in which we think that we can "just wing it"
- We need help when we are least likely to get it. We behave against our own
  interest and might not even realize it.
- "We are professionals at what we do, amateurs at what we want to become."

### The Wheel of Change

- **Creating:** A positive element that we want to create
- **Elimination:** A positive element that we want to keep
- **Accepting:** A negative element that we need to accept
- **Preserving:** A negative element that we want to eliminate

### Types of Triggers

- **Encouraging:** We want it
- **Productive:** We need it
- **Discouraging:** We don't want it
- **Counter-Productive:** We don't need it

These four categories form a rectangle which can describe several types of
behavior. **Example:** Temptation ("We want it, but don't need it").

**Exercise:** Pick a behavior goal you are pursuing. Now list all the people
and situations that influence the quality of your performance. Identify and
label the triggers related to your goal.

### Active Questions

- Passive questions ("Do you have clear goals?") allow us to take a free pass,
  meaning that we can blame someone else for a problem ("Oh my manager just
  doesn't know what he wants!").
- Active questions ("Did I do my best today to set clear goals for myself") put
  us into the driver seat. This type of question makes us accountable and asks
  us to defend our actions. They motivate us "to try".
- Rate yourself on your active questions between 1 (low) and 10 (highest).
  Report your score regularly.
- If your scores keep sinking, decide: Do I want to drop this question, or
  should I try harder?
- These active questions can be used with an hourly reminder for short burst
  applications (e.g. working with an "annoying" colleague)
